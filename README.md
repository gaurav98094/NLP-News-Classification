# Aim of the Project:

News information was not easily and quickly available until the beginning of last decade. But now news is easily accessible via content providers such as online news services.A huge amount of information exists in form of text in various diverse areas whose analysis can be beneficial in several areas. Classification is quite a challenging field in text mining as it requires prepossessing steps to convert unstructured data to structured information. With the increase in the number of news it has got difficult for users to access news of his interest which makes it a necessity to categories news so that it could be easily accessed. Categorization refers to grouping that allows easier navigation among articles. Internet news needs to be divided into categories. This will help users to access the news of their interest in real-time without wasting any time.

The project makes uses of few machine learing algorithms to classify the news into different category.The datset is collected from some online source and in saved in person system.Data may be in available in any format i.e. it may in .pdf, .doc, or in .html format.In this project the data is available in .csv format.
